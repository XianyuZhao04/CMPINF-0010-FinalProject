Description:

            Our metric for ranking the neighborhoods is health and safety. By using the datasets, Police Incident Reports, Green Space Data, and Fire Incidents, in combination with each other, we can properly represent our metric. We ranked a total of 90 neighborhoods in Pittsburgh on a scale from 0 - 10, the higher the rank the "better" it is to live in that neighborhood. We adjusted the weight of each dataset so that the more important aspect of out three datasets is weighed more than the less important datasets.

Overview:

            We ranked all the neighborhoods of Pittsbugh on a scale from 0 - 10, the higher the score the better the neighborhood is to live in, the metric of our ranking being the health and safety of each neighborhood gathered from the three datasets: Police Incident Reports, Green Space Data, and Fire Incidents.
